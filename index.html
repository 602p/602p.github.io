								<p>I'm a 16-year-old Sophmore at Washburn High in Minneapolis. I am also enrolled in PSEO (taking college classes in high school) at MCTC. I love to work with technology and computers, and am very interested in computer science topics. I've been doing FIRST FRC Robotics for six years and have been involved in a number of software projects in my free time. I am also a Boy Scout and play Ultimate Frisbee for the Washburn Wolfpack.</p>

										<li>I'm familiar with <b>HTML</b>/<b>JS</b>/<b>CSS</b>, <b>Python</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>C</b> and <b>C#</b></li>
										<li>I've used <b>Flask</b>, <b>MongoDB</b> and <b>SQLAlchemy</b>, <b>OAuth</b>, <b>PyGame</b> and <b>Pillow</b></li>
										<li>I've got a good grasp of CSci principles, and can apply skills across languages</li>
										<li>
											I've used these tools to build many projects:
											<ul>
												<li>Won <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/summer-coding-contest-results-finally/">second place</a> in the 13-and-under category of the 2011 Rasperry Pi international summer code contest for a virtual serial port interface to hardware IO on the device called serpint</li>
												<li><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/211/">Presented</a> serpint (above) at Pycon 2013</li>
												<li>Won Best Overall at CodeDay Winter 2015 as part of a team that built a <a href="https://602p.pythonanywhere.com/static/client/index.html">yelp clone for trick-or-treating</a></li>
												<li>Won Best Game at CodeDay Winter 2016 as part of a team that built a <a href="https://github.com/turnipjs/Multiplayer-Tetris">cooperative multiplayer tetris game</a> using custom UDP networking</li>
												<li>Helped launch OMGTransit at a Minneapolis Hackathon</li>
												<li>Maintained <a href="http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/151803-121-dang-it-continued/">DangIt and Entropy</a> for a time, two mods (free expansions) for the popular video game Kerbal Space Program, which together have tens of thousands of downloads</li>
												<li>Built a <a href="https://github.com/602p/blackboard">news-visualization wordcloud tool</a> in Python, with multiprocessing support</li>
												<li>Worked with a teacher at South High to build a <a href="https://github.com/602p/mps-punctuality">student attendance management system</a></li>
												<li>Build a variable-width bit-coding huffman tree <a href="https://github.com/602p/yeezip">compression codec</a> in C that utilisies an embedded Python interpreter to run a tree-optimization genetic algorithm. Can beat out GZip and Windows Zip by up to 10% in real-world use cases of compressing large text files containing mostly numbers</li>
												<li>Designed a object-oriented systems programming language called <a href="https://github.com/602p/orth">Orth</a> and built a compiler for it in Python utilizing the LLVM backend to generate executable machine code that runs on Windows and Linux</li>
												<li>Used Orth to build a Operating System from scratch using only x86 assembly and Orth. It has <a href="img/emu2.png" class="popup">VESA framebuffer support</a>, keyboard input, timer support, a full object-oriented interface to the x86 MMU Paging and Interrupt system, and is capable of running simple programs like snake with textures and a <a href="img/raycast.png" class="popup">rudimentary 3D raycaster</a>.</li>
