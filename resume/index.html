								<h4 class="u-full-width u-text-centered">Who?</h4>
								<p>I'm a 16-year-old Sophomore at Washburn High in Minneapolis. I am also enrolled in PSEO (taking college classes in high school) at MCTC. I love to work with technology and computers, and am very interested in computer science topics. I've been doing FIRST FRC Robotics for six years and have been involved in a number of software projects in my free time. I am also a Boy Scout and play Ultimate Frisbee for the Washburn Wolfpack. In my free time I like to ride my bike, do computer science stuff, and do metalworking/metalcasting stuff in my backyard.</p>
								<p>Even though I'm a young guy, I have been doing computer-science and programming stuff for a long time, and am pretty advanced. I'm familiar with technologies like web dev and server hosting, PID feedback control, graphical programming, interpreter and programming language internals, compilers and machine architecture, and even low-level OS development. I'm technically fluent, and capable of using many common software packages on Linux and Windows, and am familiar with computer and electrical hardware.</p>
