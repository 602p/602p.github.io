								<p>I'm a 17-year-old student at the University of Minnesota (Twin Cities) through  <span class="tooltipd" title="Postsecondary Education Option is a Minnesota program allowing students who have completed the available high school coursework to coenroll in college classes">PSEO</span>. My high-school-of-record is Washburn High, where I would be a Senior, but I am enrolled full-time at the U of M. I love to work with technology and computers, and am very interested in computer science topics. </p>
								<p>I'm very involved at the Association for Computing Machinery student chapter at the UMTC, where I am the Systems Administrator. I've been doing FIRST FRC Robotics for seven years and have been involved in a number of software projects in my free time. I am also a Boy Scout and play Ultimate Frisbee. In my free time I like to ride my bike, do compsci stuff, and do metal{working,casting} in my backyard.</p>
								<p>Even though I'm a young guy, I have been doing computer-science and programming stuff for a long time, and am pretty advanced. I'm familiar with technologies like web dev and server hosting, interpreter and programming language internals, compilers and machine architecture, and even low-level OS development. I'm technically fluent, and capable of using many common software packages on Linux and Windows, and am familiar with electronics and computer hardware.</p>
